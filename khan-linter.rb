  def install
    # this one is tricky to package via homebrew, because it contains a whole
    # mess of library files just sitting around in a root directory, mixed
    # with repo specific stuff.
    #
    # we can't easily change the file structure of that repo either, because
    # there are still legacy places across the codebase that expect the files to
    # live in a certain place, and hardcode that path.

    # first, lets get all the library/executable files that live in root
    root_files = [
      "githook.py",
      "hook_lib.py",
      "eslint_reporter.js",
      "eslintrc",
      "lesshint_reporter.js",
      "linters.py",
      "runlint.py",
      "static_content_refs.py",
      "lint_util.py"
    ]
    root_files.each { |f| prefix.install f }

    # the external python/node deps are vendored, so just install those
    prefix.install "vendor"
    prefix.install "node_modules"

    # the "bin" execs are actually symlinks to executable python lib files,
    # so create those symlinks rather than copying so that they point to
    # the installed versions in the Keg.
    bin.install_symlink prefix/"runlint.py" => "ka-lint"
    bin.install_symlink prefix/"githook.py" => "_ka-commit-lint"

  def caveats
    <<-EOS.undent
      Many places in the Khan Academy codebase still hardcode the path to
      khan-linter, which won't work if you are using this Homebrew installed
      version! ğŸ’©

      If you see errors that can't find "~/khan/devtools/khan-linter/runlint.py",
      you should update that script to simply use "ka-lint" picked up from the
      global system path instead.
